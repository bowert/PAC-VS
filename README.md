Project: PAC-VS


    We will be creating a version of pacman on your browser, but with a twist. It will be a two-player online game: One user will play as pac-man, and the other player will control four ghosts. The player pac-man will attempt to collect all pellets, and the other player will attempt to stop them with the ghosts. Whoever completes their objective first wins.

We will be using Django, mySql, React, Javascript, Python, and Google Cloud.
