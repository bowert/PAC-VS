Project: PAC-VS
We will be creating a version of pacman on your browser, but with a twist. It will be a two-player multiplayer game: One user will play as pac-man, and the other player will control four ghosts. The player pac-man will attempt to collect all pellets, and the other player will attempt to stop him with the ghosts. Whoever first completes their objective wins.

We will be using Django, mySql, React, Javascript, Python, and Google Cloud.
